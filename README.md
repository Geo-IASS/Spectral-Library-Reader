# Spectral-Library-Reader
C++ Library that reads the splib06a file - a custom binary spectral reflectance database file created by USGS

when splib06a is read, it provides all the information you need to graph out the spectral reflectances of the materials in the file.

You would use this class and the splib06a file if you had spectral reflectance data - for example multiband imagery - and you wanted to understand the material make up of the items in the image.
